# elquimeras custom layout for Corne Keyboard

#### Based on Soundmonster's crkb keymap

### Features:

- Modern OLED support (many thanks to @drashna):
  - Proper orientation
  - Graphic layer indicator ↑ ↓
  - Graphic modifier indicator ⌘ ⇧ ⌥ ⌃
- Similar enough to the default keymap so you can easily port your custom keymap to it
- Mac-friendly (Command and Option on the thumbs)
- Vim-friendly (Esc, `:` and Ctrl on the thumbs)
- Full per-key RGB Matrix support out of the box (you still have to go through the nightmare of soldering yourself though 😉)
